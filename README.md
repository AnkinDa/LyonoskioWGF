Hello!


My name is Ankin!
I am a Python and Lua developer.

I am "good" at creating discord bots! 


You can reach me at Ankin#0999 or lyonoskiowgf@gmail.com!

Please, if you reach me say you are from there and go straight to the point!

Oh yeah I'm also a furry! (If you don't support this don't bother contacting me for anything.)
